        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>This website is free and open to all users and there is no login requirement. It is designed to predict, prioritize, analyze, and interpret cancer genetic dependencies through the two tools:</p>
        <h3>Gene Dependency Predictor</h3>
        <p>Easy access to cancer gene dependency predictions on a group of cancer cell lines or tumors. This tab uses models trained with cancer gene expression data and post-chronos gene effect scores from <a href="https://depmap.org/portal/data_page/?tab=allData" target="_blank">DepMap</a>. There are two main types of machine learning algorithms:</p>
        <h5>DeepDEP</h5>
        <p>In the publication of DeepDEP, we systematically evaluated the prediction performance using hold-out cancer cell lines and multiple measures, including mean squared error in gene dependency scores and per-cancer cell line correlation coefficients between actual and predicted data. DeepDEP has achieved marked improvements over a diverse array of conventional methods, such as linear regression, support vector machines, and alternative deep learning models trained either with cell lines alone, without transferring features learned from tumors, or using principal components to replace encoder outputs. Furthermore, we validated the predictions with real-world clinical data from corresponding patients. For more details on the model design, validation, and applications, please refer to the publication of DeepDEP (Chiu et al., Science Advances 2021). The Python implementation of DeepDEP is available in our <a href="https://codeocean.com/capsule/7914207/tree/v1" target="_blank">Code Ocean repository</a>.</p>
        <h5>Elastic Net Models</h5>
        <p>In a recent Nature Cancer publication by Shi et al. in 2024, a relatively simple elastic net method was used to create high performing models for prediction of gene dependency. The models use an alpha of 0.5 to balance a trade off between L1 and L2 regularization and ten fold cross validation. Only models with performance greater than 0.2 measured by correlation with Depmaps Crispr knockout data are included in the web application. Although TCGA aligned models as discussed in the publication are used in the TCGA dependency explorer, the models in new prediction tool are trained only using DepMap data which is why the website limits users to uploading and comparing results to cell lines.</p>
        <h3>TCGA Dependency Explorer</h3>
        <p>Provides an exploration tool for identifying significantly intensified gene dependencies in tumors with specific alterations. The predictions of gene dependencies in TCGA tumors is performed with DeedDEP models trained on expression, mutation, methylation, and copy number alteration. The mutli omics approach provides a marginally better performance than expression only. The elastic net models used to predict TCGA gene dependency are trained following transcriptional alignment of DepMap to TCGA. With their paper, the authors also provide an Rshiny tool for exploration of results similar to this app, but with different features. Their application's source code, code for aligning transcriptional profiles of DepMap to TCGA, and code to train elastic net models can be found on <a href="https://github.com/xushiabbvie/TDtool" target="_blank">Github</a>. </p>
